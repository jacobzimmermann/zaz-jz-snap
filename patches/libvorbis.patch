Description: Link with libvorbis, too.
 This is fallout from the fact that other libraries in Debian, such as
 libvorbisfile, no longer include their own dependencies in the pkg-config
 output.  Until now, zaz built just fine because -lvorbis was added by
 other libraries; now it has to add it on its own.
 .
 This bug should really be fixed upstream by adding an explicit check for
 libvorbis in configure.ac, something like
 AC_CHECK_LIB([vorbis], [vorbis_bitrate_addblock])
 I do intend to do that in a future upload, but IMHO this minimal patch
 ought to be suitable for the Jessie freeze.
